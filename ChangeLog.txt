4.5.1:
* Added a cancel command for the rollback, that should cancel the rollback currently active.
* Added a check if the player is already rolling something back, if so don't let him do a second rollback.
* Made it so that the friends are checked entirely by the isOnFriendsList function in ConfigHandler.
